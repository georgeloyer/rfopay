README for wordpress folder
This folder holds files that are modifications of HTML and PHP files
that were on the sonic-hosted website. The modifications reflect the
changes necessary for cutting and pasting them into the wordpress
web site so that they work as pages in that infrastructure.

All of these files are in support of the payment gateway implementation
for taking credit card information and gathering other form information
from customers on the www.rfo.org website, now hosted in wordpress in
the AWS hosting environment.
