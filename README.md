README for rfopay
Created 6/5/2020
This project contains source files and deployed files for implementing
payment gateways for the www.rfo.org website hosted on Wordpress in
AWS hosting.  The pay folder originally came from authorize.net, 
downloaded directly from the site at:
https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/accept-sample-app

A docs directory contains private documentation as well as the 
documentation from authorize.net and other payment gateways as we
implement them.
